A little companion for your Postgres HA deployment on Kubernetes that labels its pods
with the current replication role 

## Motivation

If you have played with Postgres in HA, having several primary servers, you probably know Replication Manager.
This tool keeps 'primary' and 'standby' nodes synchronized and promotes 'standby' to 'primary' on failures.

This commonly implies having a proxy in front of all Postgres nodes to route writing operations to 'primary',
balance reading operations to the rest of nodes, and other advantages.

This proxy-pattern helps to mask failures in a way the client application commonly doesn't notice, 
being super useful in huge productive customer-facing systems. 

But what happens if you require HA on smaller systems?
Is the overhead of configuring perfect proxy worth? 
The answer is NO.

Replication Manager is taking care of your Postgres, so you always have a 'primary' available. 
But Kubernetes cannot distinguish the role of your nodes, or it can?

This application is a little CLI that checks the roles of your Postgres Pods from time to time, 
and labels them with the role.

This way you can create a Kubernetes Service that points always to the 'primary' 
deleting the need of a complicated proxy on small HA deployments

## Flags

Every configuration parameter can be defined by flags that can be passed to the CLI.
They are described in the following table:

| Name                          | Description                          | Default | Example                            |
|:------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|:-------:|------------------------------------|
| `--log-level`                 | Define the verbosity of the logs     | `info`  | `--log-level info`                 |
| `--disable-trace`             | Disable traces from logs             | `false` | `--disable-trace true`             |
| `--kubeconfig`                | Path to kubeconfig                   |   `-`   | `--kubeconfig="~/.kube/config"`    |
| `--disable-services-creation` | Disable the creation of the services | `false` | `--disable-services-creation=true` |
| `--sync-time`                 | Synchronization time in seconds      |  `5s`   | `--sync-time=2m`                   |

## Environment Variables

Security-critical parameters are managed by environment variables.
They are described in the following table:

| Name                   | Description                   | Default | Example                                               |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------------|:-------:|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `PG_CONNECTION_STRING` | OBDC styled connection string |   `-`   | `postgresql://username:password@postgres.namespace.svc:5432/db` |

## Examples

Here you have a complete example to use this command.

> Output is thrown always in JSON as it is more suitable for automations

```console
export PG_CONNECTION_STRING="postgresql://username:password@hostname.com:5432/db"

pg-selector run \
    --log-level=info
    --kubeconfig="./path"
```
